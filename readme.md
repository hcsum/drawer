# Drawer

An app to help people identify items truly valuable to them amoung all their possessions and help getting rid of the nonessentials.

## Todo

### Working

- feat: take pictrue
  fix: data in list not updating, might need to pass in search query to list
  fix: photo is not being saved to state
- feat: persist user inputs (maybe it will just happen when runs on a real device as real app?)
- feat: toBeRemoved item functionality
- find a way to tell user total number
- feat: light/dark theme
- feat: backup/import data
